help me add those number of results found in search query

ok i found out that on pressing enter (refreshing the page) on search, it refreshes without leaving the searched results (goes back to default)

well enter should refresh the page with the typed and wanted results eg fifa 23
as you can see in the picture and i made this class in the middle of the image/info

instead of adding new tables to the database, can i do like <span className="line-through pr-0.75">{game.old_price} €</span> <span className="text-[#84e916]">{game.discount}%</span> and the old price to be game price * some discount
or maybe delete current objects in database and add new tables - title - price - old price(if no discount then no - ill change that in the code by adding if statement) - then platform and it has to have a picture like steam/xbox/pc - then region(global, europe, asia etc ) - discount - (chargeback is fixed so ill add as a varibale that is 9.1% of price or discounted price) - likes - and picture for the card (whether its fifa, some other game), did i miss anything?
ok now step by step
